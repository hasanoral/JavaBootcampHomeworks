# Homework 2

In this assignment, you will write an object-oriented application for a shopping cart software. The software allows shopping customers to accumulate a list of products for purchase. Upon checkout, the software should calculate the total price for a order and show the products to the customer.

## The Task

In this assignment, you are given the specifications of a shopping cart application which you need to implement. The application consists of the following classes:

* A Product class representing a product to be purchased
* A DiscountedProduct subclass representing a product with x% discount
applied to it
* A Buy2Take3Product subclass representing a product for which one can
buy 2 pieces and get a third for free
* A Cart class representing the products purchased by a given customer
* A Main class representing the interface between the customer and the
shopping cart application

The specification takes the form of a set of commented java files.

# The interface, example session

# Remarks and Notation
* If a user buys the same product twice, these instances should be considered as buying different products.
* The program should terminate with IllegalArgumentException if the user chooses both the discount and the offer Buy2Take3, since Buy2Take3 products can not be discounted.
* Method getPrice requires cart as parameter, since in the subclasses the price of a product may depend on other products in the cart. Think what happens for objects of type Buy2Take3
